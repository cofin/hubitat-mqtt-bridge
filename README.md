# hubitat-mqtt-bridge
The sever uses MQTT as a bridge between Hubitat &amp; Home Assistant.

## NOTE: I used this code from February 2019 till now.  It does need to be stabilized a bit, but is functional.  There are times that I found myself needing to restart the daemon after a Hubitat restart or MQTT restart.

I use the following Z-wave components with Hubitat:
- Lights (Switches & Dimmers)
- Sensors (Motion, Lux, Temperature, Battery)
- Buttons / Controllers
- Locks
